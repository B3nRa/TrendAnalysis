I'll sign, George. @SonyPictures @Sony #georgeclooney @Deadline
@robinbmurphy @SonyPictures @washingtonpost why? if Americans had been attacked in any poor neighborhood at theatre they'd be suing Sony
@SonyPictures should just release #TheInterview for free, making an investment in free speech.

Well I can't wait to see @TheInterview ecspecially since it's ticking @KimJongNumberUn off @SonyPictures grow a back bone and let us see it
@Sony @SonyPictures I can't believe that Sony backed down from a little fat scumbag Kim Jung Un #TheInterview
@SonyPictures redo and invite Kim Jin Yu to play the part in the movie and you will convert his country to democracy

.@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Now the question must be? What did NKorea download from @SonyPictures Computers that could be so damaging if released?
@SonyPictures releasing  #TopUn to recoup losses from The Interview #Cowards @Sethrogen
@SonyPictures caving to #terrorists from #NorthKorea means #KimJongUn is ultimate censor of #American movies. Where is US gov't? #ObamaFail
@SonyPictures release "The Interview" on Netflix so N.Korea won't win in deciding what Americans can watch. Terrorism comes in all forms.
@SonyPictures Do you wanna cancel Christmas too? #foldedlikealawnchair

The @SonyPictures hack was facilitated from the inside.
I really wish @SonyPictures showed some fortitude and pressured theaters to show #TheInterviewMovie
@SonyPictures  Glad we didn't Cave in past, Be no Rambo II, III, Rocky V, Stripes, Iron Man Etc. Etc. SO sad to see this happen #SonyHack
.@Linville34 @FoxNews I believe the hacking occured. But @SonyPictures used it as an excuse to hide the disastrous #TheInterview.

@northkorea_now @SonyPictures Have NO idea if the People in  @NorthKoreaDPRK have DVD players, VHS or Film projectors but, 1 copy would do
@SonyPictures put #TheInterview on  #internet like #GeorgeClooney said. Say f-u to NKorea with a FREE freedom of speech movie! #KimJongUn
Even President Obama said that Sony fucked up by not releasing 'The Interview'. Hey @SonyPictures, how about actually releasing it now?
@PerezHilton @HarveyLevinTMZ @RobLowe @Sethrogen @SonyPictures wouldn't #TheInterview movie "accidentally" leaking online be a win/win?

#TheInterview #Jeopardy:Name the Chickenshit movie studio who backed down to FAT ASS in pajamas @KimJongUn.Who is @SonyPictures Alex? #MSNBC
I call bullshit on @SonyPictures #TheInterview is a steaming pile of shit. üí©üí©üí©
@THR of coarse @SonyPictures had a choice.  They just made a not so good one and they should just keep trying to become better humans.
@SonyPictures Think about? Streaming it, HBO, Showtime, Epix, Re do it. re-shoot some scenes, re-title it, change the plot a little.
@SonyPictures Or wait until the storm passes!
@SonyPictures there's always! The DVD mkt.!
@SonyPictures Encrypt the DVD just in case!
@Inlocalnola ....Tell FUCKING @SonyPictures CEO Michael Lynton to shut the fuck up &amp; release #TheInterview  BITCH. #PantyWearingTwat #MSNBC
@CNN we understand its comedy but clearly #NorthKorea doesnt @SonyPictures should have never made this film. And their emails.Shame
@SonyPictures release #TheInterview online and i will pay $10 american dollars for it. You can send the bill directly to #GeorgeClooney
Why is @NPR so insistent on trying to blame @SonyPictures for response to the hacking fiasco, rather than North Korea?
Hey @michaellynton : Pull your panties up you PUSSY &amp; release #TheInterview. @SonyPictures = #Cowards #Sissies #KimJongUn 's bitch. #MSNBC
@justin_kanew @npratc @SonyPictures THIS IS RIDICULOUS! HAVE YOU SEEN THE PBS, VICE N' LISA LING DOCS ON N. KOREA? WAAAAY MORE OFFENSIVE
@SonyPictures So basically, we will now be getting movies that Al Sharpton and Kim Jong Un agree on?
.@SonyPictures is full of shit- not all theaters bailed. They could have still shown it on limited screens #TheInterview
@SonyPictures   ..thanks so much for portraying Americans as submissives.. our future is now sealed...  Rt   #GetBalls
@SonyPictures you should reconsider..Make it #TheInterview  a major release in a new way..Perhaps Netflix!?...right!? @GeorgeCloooney
@Sony @SonyPictures So North Korea is behind this? You guys *definitely* need to put The Interview back up now.
The #blamegame begins @SonyPictures and coward theater chains.
BRAVO, @npratc!  Brilliant piece about The Interview hacking and @SonyPictures's need for PLATFORMS for distribution.
@Microsoft @BillGates @SonyPictures build video streaming player in @Xbox  buy online #xbox currency to purchase #TheInterview
Hackers make new demands to @SonyPictures they must now pat their head and rub their stomach at the same time.#cowards
@npratc @nprnews @SonyPictures actually "pay what you want" and bit torrent.
@SonyPictures  no Sony u had a choice its called grow a set and don't give in to spoiled little boys who think there big boys .
@NBCNightlyNews @PeteWilliamsNBC WOW! @SonyPictures R such LIARS. CAVED 2 Dictator! Stupid asses!
@SonyPictures says they didn't cave? What the fuck do you call it?
Why would @SonyPictures allow a script about the murder of a country's official to be made into a movie? This is NOT a funny topic!
@DabneyPorte yes we did, HUGE mistake &amp; CEO of @SonyPictures should be canned #Sony They still have choices though #digitalrelease
@DabneyPorte @SonyPictures HUGE issues. Others will try to do the same. At that point, drop all borders, bend over, spread them &amp; brace!
My son said it clearly, "Mom, did we NOT just negotiate with terrorists" @docmurdock @SonyPictures #TheInterview #SonyHack
@DabneyPorte @SonyPictures Smart kid. #RonaldReagan would be proud of him
Do you know @docmurdock ~ Did @SonyPictures get ANY support from #Obama prior to their decision.  Or is he playing  #ArmChairQuarterback?
@DabneyPorte @SonyPictures from what he said "they should have called me first", so if they did, he's deflecting.
@DabneyPorte @SonyPictures could GOOGLE: white house switchboard and see. It's a public listing. Monitored, but public. Just call &amp; ask!
And as I just tweeted @JimKelley7 I believe our PRESIDENT &amp; staff should have called @SonyPictures.  Wow #Obama NEVER takes responsibility
@AngieLembo @DabneyPorte @SonyPictures I'll say it: @SonyPictures FUCKED UP. I say release DIGITALLY.
It's as IF #Obama passively aggressively sabotages our country  Yet another example &gt; #SonyHack @docmurdock @JimKelly7 @SonyPictures
@AngieLembo @DabneyPorte @jimkelly7 @SonyPictures yeah, don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt want visits from MenInBlack types
I really hope @SonyPictures and @BarackObama get on the same page and decide to release #TheInterview. #USStrong #NoFear
.@SonyPictures ‚Äî and more importantly, the @WhiteHouse ‚Äî has allowed North Korea to censor the United States. #TheInterview
That's it, I'm boycotting @SonyPictures and @ParamountPics. They'll never see another penny from me. #freedom #dontbescared

@Sony @SonyPictures The Anonymous group opposes internet censorship &amp; control, you could elicit their cooperation.
@SonyPictures we want the #interviewmovie to be released!! Who care about North Korea!
@Sony @SonyPictures Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
@Sony @SonyPictures I'll never buy another sony product. #Communists
If @SonyPictures is still letting North Korea tell them what movies they can't release, my vote is for the upcoming Adam Sandler movies
Shocked that @SonyPictures Caved Man thats NOT good! We NEED to go on We can't let #Hackers Win #TheShowMustGoON!
@MittRomney @SonyPictures @TheInterview and here we have an example of a White Man in Power who cares more for a movie than Black Lives
@seanhannity @SonyPictures @TheInterview Absolutely not! There is no way this country should make such a drastic decision based on fear.
. @SonyPictures CEO says they want to release #TheInterview online. How about posting on @WhiteHouse website? Cyberattack that, North Korea.
Dumbo's got that VOD you need for @TheInterview, @SonyPictures:  @nprnews
@SonyPictures Show me the movie!!!
Puppets, I tell you. That would've been the ticket. #TheInterview @SonyPictures #TeamAmerica #NorthKorea
How can @SonyPictures not show #TheInterview do we still live in The United States of America #NotCool
@TheInterview @Sethrogen wish u all best of luck when released. @SonyPictures, @MPAA, #TheInterview need a new #NC17 rating for #Violence.
Tweets about the @SonyPictures @TheInterview are because it's about the tradition of political satire &amp; I can't believe NO ONE will show it.
@RonThornton Yeah doesn't sound like it will too soon  ;o) @MaryRachelleC @SonyPictures
I'd rather be a @SonyPictures exec flying @AirKoryo than in my current situation on @SunwingVacay #SunwingAirlines #808 #terribleservice

My Msg to @SonyPictures, freedom of speech is powerful - use responsibly and with care
It's really hard to accept @SonyPictures as a victim when they're parlaying the #SonyHack into billions in profit.
Hack of @sonypictures  means that #TheInterview is becoming the movie that everyone most wants to see
@SonyPictures Any more #ProfilesInCourage today?
@SonyPictures If you really believed in #FreeEnterprise, you wouldn't be cowed by a petty tyrant.
@lizzwinstead Sequels and rehashed premises suggest a "minimize risk at all costs" culture; if that's true @SonyPictures actions no surprise
@SonyPictures everyone  should boycott Sony pictures until they grow some balls and release #TheInterview. They could on PSN or Amazon!!
@AJEnglish @SonyPictures have done a fantastic job promoting this film eh?
Now I want to see The Interview but don't want to reward @SonyPictures for their cowardice. Are there times when piracy is morally superior?
I still think @SonyPictures r pussy's,they talkd shit bout our president &amp; their actors. They r afraid we will here more of their attacks
Shout out to @SonyPictures for their decision. It's not giving in, it's cashing in. Any publicity is good publicity.
Our Christmas tradition eat dinner go to movie. Staying home this year to protest @SonyPictures and movie theaters cowardice #ScrewNKorea
@SonyPictures stand up for freedom of speech #ScrewNKorea @GeorgeCloooney @RegalCinema@CarmikeCinemas
If @SonyPictures reversed their decision and ran @TheInterview within the next month, they'd get a serious pay day.
.@SonyPictures Great you want #TheInterview seen! 3.5k want it on Jan 8th in T.O. Can you #GetUsACopy?‚Ä¶
I guess @SonyPictures should have done a movie about assassination of #FidelCastro &amp; called it #TheNursingHome instead of #TheInterview
@anne_theriault @Jax6655 @SonyPictures @DPRK    FREEDOM OF SPEECH TRUMPS ALL
@SonyPictures If you don't get in front of this, you might as well make Kim Jong Un your CEO.
@starfishys @SonyPictures The film advocates the murder of a Head of State. What else is there to explain?
@channingtatum @SonyPictures Just wondering when is Foxcatcher going to play in Quebec City, Canada?
@SonyPictures if you are going to "chill" with Sharpton....I will no longer buy, see or patronize your films. Neither will my family. #Sony
Wouldn't it be great if @SonyPictures were able to pull a @U2 @iTunesMusic and automatically download Interview on to all N Korean computers
. @SonyPictures hires real life fixer and @comugrad alum @JudySmith_ to handle crisis:  #GoBU
Furthermore @SonyPictures im not interested in reading data that north korea stole from you. Americans dont need help divulging secrets.
Papers publishing @SonyPictures data are like groups who would buy goods stolen from US companies.
Capitulation. It happened @SonyPictures &amp;  Michael Lynton needs to own up to it. I find it hard to believe #iTunes won't take #TheInterview
What do u think? Want to see @TheInterview RETWEET if you want @SonyPictures to release #TheInterview w our friends @Zype! #SonyHack
How will @SonyPictures ever make up for #TheInterview ?!
Is NO ONE catching on to what im doing? @SonyPictures #TheInterview
Clooney on the @SonyPictures decision to cancel #TheInterview "the world just changed on your watch, and you weren‚Äôt even paying attention."
@SonyPictures should release #interviewmovie on #appletv #GooglePlay and #playstationstore on #Christmas!  #NorthKorea #Consumerism #StandUP
Still shocked by the absolute fecklessness of @Sony and @Sonypictures.  Put movie online and be unafraid of dictators with Napoleon complex.

Suck it @SonyPictures we're seeing them emails.
@PeterSandersLA IMHO strongly agreed - the action came too late by @SonyPictures. One can only wish @JudySmith_ and her team the best.
Jesus‚Ä¶ @SonyPictures make up your mind. Now you are releasing the film you said you were then weren‚Äôt, then were, then weren‚Äôt.

@TechCrunch Terrible! @SonyPictures claims its free speech issue but its an issue of protected military intel (unless they did 0 research??)
Hey @SonyPictures: make #TheInterview available to stream in Canada too. My mom's counting on you. Thanks.

Poor decision by @SonyPictures to play @TheInterview online. The small theaters that decided to show #TheInterview deserve our support.
Too bad @SonyPictures didn't release the rights to @netflix for #TheInterview.
@SonyPictures releases @TheInterview on @YouTube. Support the filmmakers:
@TheEllenShow can U ask @SonyPictures to donate profits from today's @YouTube sale of #theinterview to somewhere worthwhile? #giveback
If @SonyPictures wants to turn #TheInterview fiasco into a distro turning point they should make all VOD revenue transparent starting today
@TopS3cr3t @GooglePlay @SonyPictures awesome. Thanks for taking a stand.

Due to the hype, @SonyPictures' #TheInterview may make as much in 3 days in 300 Theaters that they were going to originally make in 3,000!
@TheInterview was terrible!  Can't believe @SonyPictures made for $400k let alone $40m!  Forget 1st Am, they needed #SonyHack + @Sethrogen
@kp3_tarheel @SonyPictures you still have to pay on YouTube

I had little interest in seeing @TheInterview but now I feel seeing it is my duty as an #American. Awesome #marketing job @SonyPictures

It's getting real between the USA and North Korea!! Pray for peace!! #Korea #USA #Internet #TheInterview
lolll we're such bullies. they hack our shit and we just bodied them and take out their internet. #TheInterview
I think theaters shock play #TheInterview and put banners up at the showings that say #IWishAMotherFuckerWould &amp; have armed #Marines there.
@CNN #Theatre to the rescue! The stage remains an enduring avenue for guerrilla-style social and political commentary! #TheInterview
Funny how Blackhat was due to release in spring of 2015. The Interview cancelled. Sounds more like studio hype to sell tics #TheInterview
So now #TheInterview isn't playing at any AMC, whatever happened to "We don't negotiate with terrorists"? #AmericaHasChanged #OverADamnMovie
If anonymous has a copy of #TheInterview &amp; releases it on torrent Christmas Day, it would go down in history as greatest lulz ever  #OpRIPNK
Yeah, I take risks #TheInterview @ Sony Pictures Studios
North Korea internet is down? That's one way to stop them from illegally downloading a bootleg copy of #TheInterview. #busted
Its a #merrychristmas on the streets of #NYC #Theinterview
I sure hope no one tells North Korea that the guy who wrote #TheInterview is Canadian.

After removing the foot from my mouth I realized #TheInterview is only playing in theaters I've never heard of before.
Only people happy about #TheInterview being released are the creators. Everyone else is pissed their lives are at risk to see other movies
Because NOBODY was going to see #TheInterview because it looks like a horrible movie.
Since Sony is now going to show #TheInterview in theaters Will Obama &amp; DOD still act upon the onset of this #CyberWar &amp; Threat from N.Korea?

@studiomoviegril I want to see #TheInterview &amp; are you showing it??  #USA  #FreedomOfSpeech
#SONY has green lite a movie about a movie studio that produces a really bad movie &amp; then fakes a cyber attack to promote it. #TheInterview
So I have to go all the way to ATL to watch #TheInterview

Great way to watch a movie #margaritas #HateUsCauseTheyAintUs #TheInterview #EternalLeader
This is like Spike Lee just said he's white. Lol #TheInterview
Haven't set foot in a theater since Red Tails. Hard to support the Movie Industry when they put out poor taste movies like #TheInterview
#ChristmasEve #TheInterview #Fireplace #ChristmasTree #Family @ Blanchard Resort
How much did they pay Eminem for that role? #TheInterview
Do not fight the tiger! #TheInterview
So far #TheInterview is freaking hilarious!  Everybody is in it!! #Xbox360 download,  rent it, buy it now! Streaming online
Never knew that about Eminem üòÇ #TheInterview
Its true, #TheInterview is not a good #movie, but it's also a vehicle for tired, poorly delivered and unfunny Asian jokes. #WhatWasThat?
Watching #TheInterview now on my tablet.
Stoked for #TheInterview at #thecrop #MerryChristmas @GoudaaCheez @TheJewPrincess
#TheInterview is honestly cracking my shit up
Is it any surprise that the Frequently hacked PSN is playing #TheInterview on PS4 yet #XboxOne had it with no problem.

Kinda disappointed with #TheInterview. 7.5/10

Watching The Interview #MerryChristmasEve #TheInterview
#TheInterview - funny movie, but violence was sometimes over the top. To what end, I don't know. #freedomprevails
In #THEINTERVIEW my favorite line was Eminem explaining the gay content in his lyrics, "Hector and his rectum were real." I screamed!
#TheInterview Kim Jung Un now take it easy manüòÇ I just watched it, with no popcorn or Soda and it's funny. #interviewmovie
Well #TheInterview is online for free if anyone wants to watch it.
#TheInterview for the family and friends of the slain officers. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
Haha now Kim Jong Un has no need for a butthole. #TheInterview
It's kick ass that #TheInterview is being released and I'm glad and all, but man that looks like a piece of shit movie. #Netflix #Maybe

"Holy fuckamoly!" #TheInterview
Kinda sucks that #TheInterview was hyped to unprecedented levels and now ppl hate on it. It was never meant to be Citizen Kane.
"This is so cool! A tank!" #TheInterview
Not letting North Korea tell me what I can watch... Just saw #TheInterview Hilarious! Worth watching.
At the end of it, I bet we'll learn that Sony was behind it all as a publicity stunt and got Obama to play along too #TheInterview
The Interview is hilarious! #TheInterview

#TheInterview ? watch spies like us. Though its funny and with a legendary cast.
"this is the bag? this is a douchebag" #TheInterview
Everyone and their momma watchin #TheInterview üò¥üò¥üò¥üéÖ
Streaming #TheInterview &amp; laughed so hard at the absurdity I nearly bled out. Quite possibly the worst film of all time. Yet, I'm compelled.
So #TheInterview wasn't a huge disappointment! So funny. And as a locations junkie I knew all the film spots lol #fb
The Interview definitely worth the watch @TheInterview Super funny movieüëçüëç #TheInterview
Couldn't be any happier watching #TheInterview right now
You're sending out a slightly cunty vibe right now. #TheInterview
I'm starting to think movie critics are just assholes who can't enjoy anything. Don't believe the critics #TheInterview is great @Sethrogen
"Look, it's really dark outside he probably doesn't see you" "he has night vision.." "HE HAS NIGHT VISION GOGGLES?!" üòÇ #TheInterview
'The tiger can see you...'"That tiger has night vision goggles!?!"#TheInterview
@drafthouse, will #TheInterview screenings at @AlamoRitz be DCP or in 35mm?
#TheInterview was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.
Had to give my Father-in-Law his Christmas present early so we could watch #TheInterview via their new #Chromecast. Hilarious movie!
I'm glad the American Cinematheque will be showing "The Interview" tomorrow and beyond. #TheInterview
And I'll watch it again! Haters gonna hate #TheInterview
#TheInterview was really bad. 2 thumbs down üëéüëé
#TheInterview was great.

#TheInterview so far so funny üòÜüôå
New plans I'm watching the Interview tomorrow as a family at my uncles üòèüôè #bestchristmasmovie #TheInterview
Wow that was bad. #TheInterview
Global controversy aside, #TheInterview is even too juvenile for Rogen &amp; Franco. Its about as worthy as any $6 VOD release could be
It's like I've been playing gay peek a boo for years. @Eminem @TheInterview #eminem #ChristmasEve #MerryChristmasEve #TheInterview
Well @TheInterview was an actual movie not just a trailer. Just basic Seth rogen and Franco stuff #TheInterview #Murica
#TheInterview &amp; the related 'censorship" shenanigans may have been the shrewdest viral-marketing/ #honeypot operation ever. Nicely played.
"You honey dicking!" #TheInterview
The acoustic of Katy Perry's "Firework" never felt so tranquil. #TheInterview
Just saw the movie that has caused some major international conflict. #TheInterview #hilarious #KatyPerry
Giving a big middle finger to North Korea and a big thumbs up to sony. #TheInterview
@Eminem is gay LMAOOO omg this movie #TheInterview
Just watched the movie that has caused some major international conflict. And iconically it was filmed in Canada. #TheInterview #KatyPerry
@RevoltTV #TheInterview is amazing so far! the #freedom to watch it makes it so much sweeter
surprised by how good #TheInterview actually was
The interview is one of the best movies I've seen in along time #TheInterview
That movie was about James Franco and his puppy, not anything else.. pssh #TheInterview #daddyissues #KatyPerry #margarita
Pretty sure #Sony just duped all of us into watching the lamest movie of the year.   #TheInterview #honeypot #Atrocious #Murica #bamboozled
Haters gonna hate. Ain'ters gonna ain't.#TheInterview
Damn @Sethrogen that looks like it fucking hurts lmfao #TheInterview #TheyHateUsCauseTheyAintUs
#FuckNorthKorea #TheInterview Lives @ TheDirtyMoney Frat
#TheInterview is classic, James Franco is King
- Fuckers hate us ‚Äòcause they ain‚Äôt us.- They hate us ‚Äòcause we ‚Äúanus‚Äù? ¬© #TheInterview :D
#TheInterview: Starts well &amp; has genuinely-funny moments but, overall, it's not unique or memorable. 2/5 #vanzos
Watching #TheInterview ... take that, North Korea! USA! USA! USA!
What is sleep üëåüëå #TheInterview
Is #TheInterview worth watching??
About to watch #TheInterview üòÇ
Movie time. #theinterview #moviesathome @ Home
Think I might get the movie #TheInterview on google play only 6.99$ good price too
They hate us because they anus! #TheInterview
I want two hours and the care I had back. Going to watch This is the End to remember why I thought I'd want to watch this. #TheInterview
Hectors rectum is real #TheInterview
Time to watch #TheInterview with the fam
I had no desire to see it before, &amp; I won't see it now. #TheInterview
Thank you Ronnie Raygun for the Star Wars Project. Without it millions of North American lives would have perished today #TheInterview #fb

Watching #theinterview hilarious &amp; very entertaining. Franco &amp; Rogen kill it #katyperryfirework
Fuck you North Korea! #TheInterview
This song was in #TheInterview Haha Major Lazer "Pon De Floor":
FUCK YOU NORTH KOREA #TheInterview
Just saw #TheInterview on YouTube/Chromecast. Nice move by #Sony and well worth the $5.99.
The Interview alone was a work of art but seeing @ders808 completely made it for me #TheInterview
Some scenes are really dumb, but I'm loving some of the dialogues and references #TheInterview
He's fucking peanut butterrrrr and jealoussss üòÇüòÇüòÇ #TheInterview
I can totally understand the mixed reviews, but overall I'm enjoying it so far #TheInterview
"This is like Spike Lee just said he's white!" #TheInterview already got me cracking up 6:30 minutes in.1 hour and 52 minutes left now
Fell asleep half way into #TheInterview so yah, I'm disappointed.
The star of #TheInterview is without question @katyperry #fireworks

"#THEINTERVIEW¬†IS A BAD MOVIE THAT TRIVIALIZES ONE OF THE WORST ONGOING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ON OUR PLANET"
Shout out to @TheJackieDean for getting me hip so I could watch #TheInterview.

#theinterview I was praying for the tiger to eat those two fucking douchebags alive.  What an embarrassment.

So I was going to watch #TheInterview  on YouTube but my name and zip code was needed...Nice try Kim Jung un. Nice try.
To think Sony, Obama, N. K. were all part of a publicity stunt for this turd I feel like we're in a Dali painting. Confused. #TheInterview
#TheInterview  was pretty damn funny my wife even laughed.
Just watched #TheInterview on Google Play. I actually think it's funny and shouldn't be taken so seriously.
Happy to pay $5 for #TheInterview and watch it at home. To spend a $ more Id a been pissed. Predictable move overhyped. #SethRogan movies
I didn't plan on seeing #TheInterview until all of the controversy started, so I watched because 'Merica.
Alright. Is this movie really worth paying $6 to watch? #TheInterview
#TheInterview #jamesfrancotv finished seeing The Interview. Had me laughing until the end.
#TheInterview was hilarious
The digital+theatrical release of #TheInterview is epic btw, even if the film is panned. I hope all movies switch to this release formula.
Merry Xmas finishing up watching #TheInterview definitely no #PineappleExpress. 8.9 @IMDb seems just a tad bit excessive...
#whatif, after all the hype, #TheInterview sucks? Here tell that the reviews aren't that great. I might watch it, and I might not.
#TheInterview was pretty funny. Not on the level of Pineapple Express but pretty good all around. 7/10 would blow up Kim Jong Un again.
@Sethrogen Thanks for your dedication with #TheInterview I can't wait to see it!
Wish I was at @cinefamily tonight but Santa will be delivering my gift of a 10:15am showing of #TheInterview when I wake up. Merry Xmas!!!
So much free publicity for what looks like a crap movie. Well played, #Sony #TheInterview

I'm so glad I rented #TheInterview , it is a very funny movie
well #TheInterview was successful, if its mission was to make the situation in North Korea a joke that wasn't even that funny.
idc what anyone says The Interview was mad funny #TheInterview
Watching #TheInterview rn, good call with day 1 streaming @Sony :)
Some of it was hilarious. A great choice if you're a 13 year old boy.  Over the top gross however IMO #TheInterview
The titles were fabulous, and good theme music.  #TheInterview
Just watched #TheInterview and it was moderately disturbing at first glance but it had heart. I wonder how the real version really was... üòëüöÄ
I've obviously not fully appreciated Katy Perry's music till I heard Fireworks in  #TheInterview
Will watch #TheInterview at Cinema Village in NYC tonight. Ready to laugh my way towards protecting #freedom
Yes it here‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è #freespeech #theinterview #sony Sony shouldn't have backdown in the first place @‚Ä¶

Seth Rogen drops in on midnight screening of #TheInterview. More from @NBCNews:
#TheInterview was awesome
So after watching #TheInterview are we still really thinking North Korea really hacked Sony? Or are we thinking box office gold?
@Eminem is in the #TheInterview movie . This is a funny scene
And by that yes I mean I too will be renting a copy of #TheInterview to stream sometime this weekend...

Merry Christmas to all those who celebrate! For me, it‚Äôs holiday movies, Chinese food, and then watching #theinterview!

The only thing more ridiculous than the initial controversy over #TheInterview are the idiots trying to defend it with the 1st amendment...
Apparently @Sony releasing #TheInterview means I can't play 2K. @PlayStation

I gotta say that The Interview was pretty damn funny! #TheInterview #PB&amp;Jealous hahaüòÇüòÇ
OK, the Siberian tiger scene was mildly amusing, probably because it wasn't as goddamn racist as everything else. #TheInterview

#TheInterview Is Definitely a movie to watch under Influence of something lol
Saw "The Interview" Christmas Day - surprisingly entertaining! #TheInterview #mustseeforlaughs #actionfilmascomedy
After watching #TheInterview, I cannot but think that it was all an elaborate hoax to drive people to see an absolutely terrible movie.
I am not going to see #TheInterview because I think it probably sucks ass, not because I am scared of North Korea or terrorists.#freedom
James Franco DM me and payed me to tell all my followers to go see #TheInterview so i will i guess
Everyone go see #TheInterview today before you return gifts and go shopping to buy stuff with your #XmasMoney
Hmm... If I had a mediocre movie, wld I rather have 300 Theaters sold out every show or sparsely populated 3,000? #TheInterview #Winning
I LOVED #TheInterview
@ichindea it was on #GooglePlay for $5.99 #TheInterview
#TheInterview felt so real! Awesome movie! My eyes are more open now
I wanna watch #TheInterview! lol
Wonder if all the hype about #TheInterview is a studio ploy to get butts in the seats to watch it. Would you have gone to see without hype?
#TheInterview was actually really funny tbh üòÇ
Happy I joined my fellow Americans in the great #TheInterview Christmas Day viewing. Plus it was pretty funny, truth be told.
@StoriedFirearms #TheInterview Screw the hackers-Glad Sony released - we should never bow down to threats
Feel sorry for those people who risked their lives to go watch #TheInterview in theaters....that shit SUCKED! #HOTGARBAGE
Just bought "The Interview" from @GooglePlay - hats off to theaters and companies who have made it possible #TheInterview
Not surprised, but not a good movie! RT 'The Interview' leads movie sales on Google Play, Youtube #TheInterview
Watched #TheInterview last night. Pretty funny. I can see why Un is pissed off, I'm sure the representation is spot on. #HateUsCauseTheyAnus
The interview is the best comedy ever #TheInterview
this is what's trending ... we are in deep dodo #TheInterview#DoctorWho#ILoveBTS#IdGiveAnythingFor
Fun fact #TheInterview is really a conceptual performance collab by Matthew Barney and Jeff Koons.
This is why #Americans are stupid, #CiA tortured people, the US droned innocent ppl &amp; Americans are worried about #TheInterview
"Why would I go see #TheInterview and watch a bunch of clowns."

NOW we're talking, @netflix! You make me proud! Via @Variety: ICYMI: Netflix is in talks to stream #TheInterview

What are the chances that the day @coryhjensen gets #xboxone they get hacked....#xboxlivedown #TheInterview
#TheInterview was hilarious last night!
The stock market started higher today. It's almost always up on the 26th. #playstion and #xbox are still down but millions saw #TheInterview
The sad thing was #TheInterview was not that great. Seems like Sony is pretty dumb to green light this film. Whatever.
Didn't see #TheInterview but saw #TheGambler and it was really good. Check it out!
Just watched #theinterview  thought it was hilarious. If your looking for mindless comedy for entertainment, this is the movie for you.
I suspect the term honey pot will be used more frequently in 2015. #TheInterview
Yes, Hector's rectum is real #TheInterview  :-)
Would anyone outside the U.S understand the raunchy humor of Rogen/Franco in #TheInterview? They "honey potted" us all into watching!
#theinterview is hilarious!
Hey North Korea. 'You hate us cause you ain't us!' #TheInterview
So #TheInterview "controversy" has turned Rogen and Franco in martyrs for free speech. Thanks for taking the bait America. IT'S A WORK!!!
I wish more movies would do like #TheInterview did, just put them for rent online
#GoodMornin' Movies W/ Myself ! #TheInterview During #StefTime üíÅüòÅ @ The Buddah Lounge B&amp;B
Is Xbox live still down or is it just me? Fucking hackers.Is this because of #TheInterview? I already watched it fuckers! Free speech wins!
Are you going to see #TheInterview? It's playing at a couple theaters nearby.
Never imagined that I'd be quoted in the @NYTimes and the @NYPost on the same day. What are the odds of that happening? #TheInterview
Consider Kim Jong Un's Boxing Day review of The Interview- he didn't like it-  #TheInterview
"If listening to Katy Perry and drinking margaritas is gay, then who wants to be straight??" üòÇüòÇ #TheInterview
#TheInterview  Seems Sony knew exactly how to get people to show up to  see a less than stellar movie. #PRsuccess
Hopefully @Ayyyo_bitch and @emilycihlar want to watch #TheInterview when they get here..

Despite its commercial success online, #TheInterview was illegally downloaded 750,000 times on Xmas day alone
@Amazon_FireTV Is Amazon going to get the release of the Interview? I don't see it in the new Movie releases to rent. #TheInterview
Woke up thinking about how bad #TheInterview was. Dreamt about it too. Can't believe so much hoopla for such a terrible movie.
"when i say things about gay people, people think my lyrics are homophobic, it's because i'm gay" haha i fuckin' love Eminem üòÇ #TheInterview
Because what else are you suppose to do the day after Christmas? With chcscwccrlscn #theinterview‚Ä¶
The most memorable scenes of #TheInterview were the on-point usages of the word "butthole". Super underrated word!

Sticking it to the man. Watching #TheInterview. (@ Alamo Drafthouse Marketplace in New Braunfels, TX)
Ummm, the Sony hack is not a HOAX to get more people to watch #TheInterview
In case you missed it, the most important part of #TheInterview:
Watched #TheInterview If you are a teenager who smokes pot you will love it.  Me not so much.
I ain't worried about nothing! "They hate us cuz they ain't us"üòÇüòÇüòÇ #theinterview #movies #funny
#TheInterview someone has a link of the movie?! Preferably wit subtitles:)?
Damn! I must have missed all those 9/11-style terror attacks in theatres, yesterday. N. Koreans are such noobz. #TheInterview
I've now defied the supreme leader of North Korea three times in the past twelve hours. Just being an activist. #TheInterview
In new twist, critics say #TheInterview is actually a pretty terrible movie. Sony revealed this in leaked emails.
#TheInterview Only a bad movie could start this culture war. Article is good and explains hatred of #Sony
#TheInterview is so funny üòÇüòÇüòÇ
#TheInterview was worth the $6 rental on Google Play. I'll be buying it when it comes out.
If #TheInterview experiment with day one digital is successful (and I think it will be) then we're going to be seeing this a lot more. A LOT
Spent X-mas night singing the National Anthem w/the cast of #TheInterview! Long live #freedomofspeech!
Dave Skylark never backs down from a jerk off. #TheInterview
The interview is funny at times but when it's funny it's vary funny it's a movie that after watching will give you pride #TheInterview
Watching #TheInterview
#TheInterview SEE THIS ASAP!!!! Haven't laughed this hard in ages! Screw the critics! People of North Korea, REVOLT!!
Finally watching #TheInterview  with free posters! Lol with mm.77 kierrmendoza  :)#SonyPictures @‚Ä¶

#TheInterview illegally downloaded 750k times.. Hahaha hilarious.
If you think all that shit over #TheInterview WASN'T a stunt, open those eyes.
Sony was wise not to release "The Interview".The movie was truly a waste.it was 100 million to make but definetly not worth it #TheInterview
Even after all of the promotional propaganda, I still cant bring myself to pay for another @Sethrogen movie. #TheInterview

The message #TheInterview sends is wildly sensational. If N. Korea nation made a movie about killing President Obama, U.S.A. would be livid.
@TonyDasco So did you hit an indie movie house to watch, or just bite the bullet and buy a copy online? Or... Say #fuckit? #TheInterview
@WestEndCinemaDC cheering for #TheInterview Xmas Day!
#TheInterview flak was a publicity stunt gone wrong? If true, I understand the stunt was better than the movie?

The killing of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a key part of Al Qaeda's preparation for 9/11, was by fake journalists. That doesn't excuse #TheInterview

Watching #TheInterview with my baby!  20 minutes in and this shits great. North Koreans are a fuckin joke!
Oh wait, I forgot to tweet to let everyone and North Korea know that I watched #TheInterview. #SuchABadAss #sarcasm
#I really really liked #TheInterview
#TheInterview had so many big ticket comedy cliches ... Was there a need for the love Interests?
Just rented #TheInterview on Xbox Live and it was funny as hell!#peanutbutterandjealous
#TheInterview I probably shouldn't keep trying to find any deeper layers ... Franco and Rogan's banter can only hold me for so long
Can't stop watching it #TheInterview

.@bartlesome Then I will give you my review when I have one. We plan to see #TheInterview, fittingly, in the City of Angels.
Watched #TheInterview funny but not hilarious. I would say 4 out of 5.
I'm just doomed. There's no way forward. No opportunities I can get. #TheInterview #despair #failedintellectual
I'll never hear Katy Perry's Firework the same way again after #TheInterview. Wasn't a fan before.. kinda am now #TheyHateUsCauseTheyAintUs

"They hate us cuz they anus" and "he just peanut butter and jealous" are my new favorite lines #TheInterview
With the success of #TheInterview I'm going to make a porno called Kim Jong-Unnnnnn
I feel that watching #TheInterview that night was ruined when Teresa said she'll let me know what she think about NK cartoons the next day.
#TheInterview: Were we played?
I have seen #TheInterview, my expectations are answered. Did Kim die? Yes. In the most horrible way possible? As far as NK is concerned, yes
The last tweet is obviously a movie spoiler. Sorry for those who want to keep #TheInterview as a surprise when they see it. LOL Not really.
#TheInterview This film is fantastic... And now we are curious to see the same in real life LOL
I now know that Kim jon-un is a huge Katy Perry fan thanks to #TheInterview

#TheInterview turned out to be MUCH funnier than i thought.Was a fun movie almost trumps #PineappleExpress imo for laughs!#WatchIt
Watched #TheInterview A movie has to be pretty bad when the controversy surrounding it was more entertaining than the movie itself.
Anyone else that seen #TheInterview have that katy perry song stuck in their head ? Lol
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for #TheInterview &amp; freedom of speech. I applaud #Sony for their decision. I just want to play some #Videogames
I've tried watching #TheInterview 3 times now. Get through about 20 minutes each time before having to stop because it's so bad.
#TheInterview could make online premieres popular in #Hollywood   by @adra_la @RWW
